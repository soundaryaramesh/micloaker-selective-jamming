## Sample Files Information
We provide target speech and jamming noise files corresponding to five speakers chosen from the LibriSpeech dataset. We use these for all the evaluation in the paper. Note that the ultrasound files have two channels, corresponding to the carrier frequency and modulated signal, each to played through one of the 3x3 arrays.
