# MiCloaker Audio Recordings
Here, we share the _jammed (mic-without-structure)_ and _unjammed (mic-with-structure)_ audio recordings, across five different _signal-to-jamming ratios (SJRs)_, for two carrier frequencies, 25 kHz and 32.8 kHz. These recordings correspond to Section 6.1 in the paper. We also share the original transmitted audio files -- phoneme-noise and target-speech files, separately, in the _transmitted-audio_ folder. 

## Points to Note
* Listening to the jammed recordings _after_ listening to either the _un-jammed_ recordings or the clean transmitted speech audio, will significantly reduce its jamming effectiveness to the human ear. **_So please listen to the jammed recordings first._**
