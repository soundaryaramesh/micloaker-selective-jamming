This folder contains STL files for MiCloaker's waveguide as well as resonator designs. The waveguide has four slots for inserting resonators. Resonators, labeled 1-6 and 7-12, correspond to a carrier frequencies 32.8 kHz and 25 kHz, respectively. Note that resonator cylinders have internal cavities corresponding to Helmholtz structures.
